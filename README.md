My thesis: https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/9113432

In order for the HRTF-related code to work you'll need to implement a function called calibrate_setup_measured.m which should return [(Coordinate of microphones), (Coordinates of the left ear), (Coordinate of the right ear), (Sound source position)] as well as download

and RIEC_hrir_subject_080 from
https://sofacoustics.org/data/database/riec/

Section 2.2 and equation (2.46) of the thesis might be of special interest :)
